Hi, I'm Pierre, fresh beCoder student from Oostende.
I'm very enthousiast about learning new super powers like Javascript, HTML and Ju-Jitsu Br√©silien.

### What i'm looking forward :

### The three best quality to working together :

- Patience. We don't work as same as others, every one got his own kind of intelligence.
- Communication. You can't expect the other know what you are doing or think about. Be explicive and speak!
- Humility. Every one in a team has his own knowledge, situation and role.
