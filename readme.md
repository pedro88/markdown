## BeCoder

Hi, I'm Pierre, fresh beCoder student from Malmedy.
I'm very enthousiast about learning new super powers like Javascript, HTML and CSS.

### Some of my surprising skills :

- Making Chocolate
- Practicing screen printing on crepes
- Builing my own analogic cameras

###  My favorite three things in the universe :

- ** Foraging ** mushrooms
- Reading a new Sci-Fi novel
- Hiking

### My Becode objectives :

My goal is to learn new programming skills and find new brainfucked challenge to achieve.

### My fears :

lol

### What i'm looking forward :

I'm really impatient to start group projects and challenging our teamwork skills with our new super powers.

### The three best quality to working together :

- Patience. We don't work as same as others, every one got his own kind of intelligence.
- Communication. You can't expect the other know what you are doing or think about. Be explicive and speak!
- Humility. Every one in a team has his own knowledge, situation and role.
